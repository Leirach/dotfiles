# dotfiles

Run this:

``` 
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leirach/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | bash
```
^^^ Actually don't do that, git clone, then run the script


## TODO

- better install script lmao
- .zshrc for any username, particularly this line `export ZSH="/home/juandl/.oh-my-zsh"`
- remove a bunch of unused trash in .zshrc, I pretty much only need the themes
